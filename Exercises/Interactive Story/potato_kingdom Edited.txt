“THE POTATO KING” was a really good ruler. He took care of his potatoes by treating them fairly and kindly so they can feel safe and can live happily together. And, he always tried to make the right choices for the prosperity and peace of his kingdom.
When “THE POTATO KING” bacame old, he started to lose control over his kingdom. And with time some of the potatoes started to get ruined and tried to make troubles inside the kingdom by affecting the other potatoes.  
“THE POTATO KING” didn't like that. He started to think about plans to bring back the peace and safety inside his kingdom. But what he could do?
