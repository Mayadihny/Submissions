        <h2>The Doors</h2>
        <p><b>The Doors</b> were an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1965, with vocalist Jim Morrison, keyboardist Ray Manzarek, guitarist Robby Krieger, and drummer John Densmore. They were among the most controversial and influential rock acts of the 1960s, mostly because of Morrison's lyrics and his erratic stage persona, and the group was widely regarded as representative of the era's counterculture<br />
        <i>The band took its name from the title of Aldous Huxley's book The Doors of Perception, itself a reference to a quote by William Blake. After signing with Elektra Records, the Doors released eight albums in five years, some of which are considered among the greatest of all time,[citation needed] including The Doors (1967), Strange Days (1967), and L.A. Woman (1971).</i> <br />
        <small>"By 1972 the Doors had sold over 4 million albums domestically and nearly 8 million singles."</small</p>
